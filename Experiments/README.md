# General SFU CSLab experiment and eye tracking notes  


## Software    

All of our experiments have been coded in either E-Prime or the Psych Toolbox for Matlab.


### E-Prime

## Eye trackers

Most of the experiments listed here use Tobii X120 trackers, sampling at 120hz, but we are also modifying some experiments to use more affordable 60hz Eye Tribe trackers.
